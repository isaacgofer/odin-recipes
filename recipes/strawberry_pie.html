        <h2>Preparation</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>For the crust: In a bowl, whisk together flour and salt. Cut in butter using a pastry blender or your fingers until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually add ice water, mixing until dough comes together. Wrap in plastic wrap and chill for at least 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). On a lightly floured surface, roll out dough to a 12-inch circle. Transfer to a 9-inch pie plate. Trim and crimp edges.</li>
            <li>For the filling: In a saucepan, combine sugar, cornstarch, and water. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until mixture thickens and becomes clear. Remove from heat and stir in lemon juice.</li>
            <li>Add strawberries to the filling and gently mix.</li>
            <li>Pour filling into the pie crust.</li>
            <li>Bake for 45-50 minutes, or until crust is golden brown. Let cool completely before serving.</li>
            <li>Top with whipped cream, if desired.</li>
        </ol>
